This is my output for "Learn Bash Scripting by Building Five Programs" on FreeCodeCamp.
A part of the Relational Database course which can be found at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/

Description:
"Bash scripts combine terminal commands and logic into programs that can execute or automate tasks, and much more. In this 220-lesson course, you will learn more terminal commands and how to use them within Bash scripts by creating five small programs."
